This repository contains the core smart contracts for the Lopo Protocol.

## Getting Started

0. If you are on VS Code, install Nomicfoundation/hardhat-solidity or JuanBlanco/solidity (select one for solidity) and
   Tamasfe/even-better-toml as extensions.
   ([Learn more](https://book.getfoundry.sh/config/vscode#integrating-with-vscode))

1. Install [Forge](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation) and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation)

2. Install npm packages

    ```sh
    pnpm install
    ```

3. Install foundry libraries

    ```sh
    forge install
    ```

## Writing Tests

To write a new test contract, you start by importing [PRBTest](https://github.com/PaulRBerg/prb-test) and inherit from
it in your test contract. PRBTest comes with a pre-instantiated [cheatcodes](https://book.getfoundry.sh/cheatcodes/)
environment accessible via the `vm` property. If you would like to view the logs in the terminal output you can add the
`-vvv` flag and use [console.log](https://book.getfoundry.sh/faq?highlight=console.log#how-do-i-use-consolelog).

This template comes with an example test contract [Foo.t.sol](./test/Foo.t.sol)

## Usage

This is a list of the most frequently needed commands.

### Build

Build the contracts:

```sh
$ forge build
```

### Clean

Delete the build artifacts and cache directories:

```sh
$ forge clean
```

### Compile

Compile the contracts:

```sh
$ forge build
```

### Coverage

Get a test coverage report:

```sh
$ forge coverage
```

Get a .lcov coverage report

```sh
$ forge coverage --report lcov
```

### Deploy

Deploy to Anvil:

```sh
$ forge script script/Deploy.s.sol --broadcast --fork-url http://localhost:8545
```

For this script to work, you need to have a `MNEMONIC` environment variable set to a valid
[BIP39 mnemonic](https://iancoleman.io/bip39/).

For instructions on how to deploy to a testnet or mainnet, check out the
[Solidity Scripting](https://book.getfoundry.sh/tutorials/solidity-scripting.html) tutorial.
